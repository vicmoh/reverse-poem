Enter the poem:
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul.
Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.
About a prophecy which says that G
This day should Clarence closely be mew’d up,–
As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,
And if King Edward be as true and just
In deadly hate the one against the other:
To set my brother Clarence and the king
By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
I am determined to prove a villain,
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,–
And therefore,–since I cannot prove a lover,
And descant on mine own deformity:
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;–
And that so lamely and unfashionable
Into this breathing world scarce half made up,
Deform’d, unfinish’d, sent before my time
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
I, that am curtail’d of this fair proportion,
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am rudely stamp’d, and want love’s majesty
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
But I,–that am not shap’d for sportive tricks,
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,–
And now,–instead of mounting barbed steeds
Grim-visag’d war hath smooth’d his wrinkled front;
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Our stern alarums chang’d to merry meetings,
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
And all the clouds that lour’d upon our house
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
Now is the winter of our discontent
