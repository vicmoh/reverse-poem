Enter the poem:
And now instead of mounting barbed steeds
Grimvisag’d war hath smooth’d his wrinkled front
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures
Our stern alarums chang’d to merry meetings
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried
And all the clouds that lour’d upon our house
Made glorious summer by this sun of York
Now is the winter of our discontent
