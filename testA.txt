Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York
And all the clouds that lour’d upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments
Our stern alarums chang’d to merry meetings
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures
Grimvisag’d war hath smooth’d his wrinkled front
And now instead of mounting barbed steeds
.
